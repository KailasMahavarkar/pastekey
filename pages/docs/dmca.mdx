DMCA and other applicable laws.

As part of our response, we may remove or disable access to material residing on a site

also in accordance with the DMCA.

**{env.APP_WITH_DOMAIN}** does not control content hosted on third party websites,
and cannot remove content from sites it does not own or control.
